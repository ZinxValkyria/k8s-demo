# CDN Service
This service serves static files for the frontend service

It is configured using nginx and a simple try_files directive

All content on the server is unauthenticated apart from basic https encryption (TODO)

(!) frontend's package.json build script is configured to run postbuild.sh and copy required files across

run this command to build the image:
```sh
docker compose build
```

and this on to push it to the registry:
```sh
docker push apolloxiv/k8s-cdn
